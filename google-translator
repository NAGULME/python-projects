The interface supports multiple languages including English, Telugu, Hindi, and Tamil, and features a user-friendly design with background images.

### 2. **Weather App with GUI**
A simple weather application built with Python and tkinter, fetching live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to enter a city name and receive real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The project demonstrates API integration and GUI design in Python.

### 3. **Personal Expense Tracker**
A Python-based personal finance tool that helps users track their daily expenses. The application features a user-friendly interface built with tkinter, allowing users to input, categorize, and analyze their spending. The project showcases database management using SQLite and data visualization with matplotlib.

### 4. **Automated Web Scraper**
A powerful web scraping tool developed in Python using BeautifulSoup and Requests. This project allows users to extract data from websites, automate data collection tasks, and save the results in various formats such as CSV or JSON. It's an excellent project for learning about web scraping techniques, data parsing, and data storage.

### 5. **Chatbot using NLP**
A Python chatbot leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide intelligent responses to user queries. The chatbot is built using NLTK and includes features like sentiment analysis, context understanding, and predefined responses. This project demonstrates the integration of NLP libraries and the creation of interactive, conversational agents.

### 6. **Image Recognition with Deep Learning**
